# Web-Design-Challenge

The purpose of this project is to create website that shows the results of various plots. 

The first step is to create the index.html file using the graphs provided. I used html to create the 7 pages required. I used a .css file to format the pages along with bootstrap. I used jupyter notebook to convert the cities.csv into a html file. Thanks to some help from my classmates, I was able to find the format of using an iframe to embed the cities data table into my site.
